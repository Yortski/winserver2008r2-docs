### VirtualBox (Oracle)
We need Virtual Box to host the virtual machine that will install our disc image.

To that, just head over to [oracle.com/virtualization/virtualbox/](https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/virtualbox/) and download an installer that fits your machine. As I am on a Windows machine, I am getting the Windows Installer.
